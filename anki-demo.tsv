<h4>What is Spaced Repitition?</h4><!-- #tags:  --><p><strong>Whats the idea behind it and why is it useful?</strong></p>	<p>Spaced Repition is a <em>learning technique</em>, that helps you to learn and remember new knowledge effectively. It accounts for the fact, that well-know material needs to be rehearsed much less often than new material. Ideally the optimal time interval for every card is estimated individually, which is for example implemented in the Anki-algorithm.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced Repitition on Wikipedia</a>. <!-- end backside --></p>	<h4>What is Spaced Repitition?</h4>
<h4>Requirements of Using r2anki</h4><!-- #tags: ** --><p><strong>Which software do you need to install prior to using r2anki?</strong></p>	<p>Because r2anki connects <em>R</em> to <em>Anki</em>. You need to have (<em>R</em> and) Anki installed. You should also import the r2anki-Notetype to Anki, so that the markup for the Anki-cards looks nice.</p><p><code>r2anki::install_anki()</code> is a little function to help get you started. :-) <!-- end backside --></p>	<h4>Requirements of Using r2anki</h4>
<h4>r2anki-Initialization</h4><!-- #tags: ** --><p><strong>When you first want to use r2anki, you need to initialize Anki</strong> Why is this necessary and how do you do it?</p>	<p>In Anki the styling of the cards is defined by “Note Types”, which may contain html and CSS-information. <code>r2anki::r2anki(init = TRUE)</code> will copy a few Anki-cards with the r2anki-styling to Anki, so that the R Markdown-output can be rendered properly. <!-- end backside --></p>	<h4>r2anki-Initialization</h4>
<h4>How do you create your own r2anki-notebook?</h4><!-- #tags:  -->	<p>You can give yourself a headstart by using the R Markdown-Template, that comes with r2anki. You can also use the RStudio-addin to add a new card to your notebook.</p><p>Basically <em>any</em> R Markdown-file, that contains r2anki-cards (defined by a certain markup) can be parsed to an Anki-deck. <!-- end backside --></p>	<h4>How do you create your own r2anki-notebook?</h4>
<h4>How do you export cards from an r2anki-notbook to Anki?</h4><!-- #tags:  --><p><strong>How do you get your cards from the r2anki-notebook exported to Anki?</strong></p>	<p>You just save the r2anki-notebook and call <code>r2anki::r2anki()</code> on the Rmd-file. When you set <code>invoke_anki = TRUE</code> Anki will automatically be started, ready to import your cards. <!-- end backside --></p>	<h4>How do you export cards from an r2anki-notbook to Anki?</h4>
